<h1>C-Assert</h1>
<p>Single-file unit-testing library for C</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Single header file, no other library dependencies</li>
<li>Simple ANSI C. The library should work with virtually every C(++) compiler on
virtually any playform</li>
<li>Reporting of assertion failures, including the expression and location of the
failure</li>
<li>Stops test on first failed assertion</li>
<li>ANSI color output for maximum visibility</li>
<li>Easily embeddable in applications for runtime tests or separate testing
applications</li>
</ul>
<h2>Todo</h2>
<ul>
<li>Disable assertions on definition, to allow production build without source modifications</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example Usage</h2>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &quot;test.h&quot;
#include &quot;mylib.h&quot;

void test_sheep() {
  ASSERT(&quot;Sheep are cool&quot;, are_sheep_cool());
  ASSERT_EQUALS(4, sheep.legs);
}

void test_cheese() {
  ASSERT(&quot;Cheese is tangy&quot;, cheese.tanginess &gt; 0);
  ASSERT_STRING_EQUALS(&quot;Wensleydale&quot;, cheese.name);
}

int main() {
  RUN(test_sheep);
  RUN(test_cheese);
  return TEST_REPORT();
}
</code></pre>
<p>To run the tests, compile the tests as a binary and run it.</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>This library was heavily based on the
<a href="https://github.com/joewalnes/tinytest">tinytest</a> library by
<a href="https://github.com/joewalnes">Joe Walnes</a>. A license reference to his library
could not be found, which is why this reference is in this file. Should I be
contacted about licensing issues, I'll investigate further.</p>
